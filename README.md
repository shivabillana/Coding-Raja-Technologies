Chatbot with Intent Recognition and Learning Mechanism
Overview
This project is a text-based chatbot that recognizes user intents based on predefined keywords and generates appropriate responses. The chatbot can learn from user feedback to improve its responses over time.

Requirements
 Python 3.6+
 NLTK
 NumPy
 
Setup
1.Install Dependencies:
    pip install nltk numpy
      
2.Download NLTK Data:
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    
3.Project Files:
    .chatbot.py: The main script containing the chatbot code.
    .data.txt: A file containing sentences to be processed (one sentence per line).
    .interaction_logs.json: A file to log user interactions and feedback.
    
Functions and Flow
1. Text Preprocessing
preprocess_text(text): Lowercases the text, removes non-alphanumeric characters, and tokenizes it.
2. Intent Recognition
recognize_intent(tokens): Identifies the intent of the user's input based on predefined keywords.
3. Response Generation
generate_response(intent): Generates a response based on the recognized intent.
4. Logging Interactions
log_interaction(user_input, tokens, intent, response, feedback): Logs the user input, tokens, recognized intent, generated response, and user feedback to interaction_logs.json.
5. Learning from Feedback
load_logs(): Loads previous interactions from the log file.
update_model_from_logs(): Updates the model by analyzing feedback and identifying intents that received negative feedback.
6. Running the Chatbot Loop
The chatbot runs in a loop, processing user input, recognizing intents, generating responses, logging interactions, and updating the model based on feedback.


Future Improvements
Enhance intent recognition with machine learning models.
Expand predefined intents and responses.
Implement more sophisticated natural language processing techniques.
